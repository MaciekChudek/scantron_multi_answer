A windows program for taking the data generated by a "scantron" machine, and grading it in non-standard ways. Specifically, for any question you can specify more than one correct answer and a scoring scheme for specifying more or fewer than the correct choices. Instruct students: "Put a mark in the dot corresponding to *each* correct answer. There may be more than one."
